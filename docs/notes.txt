Dashboard is the last service still using saver.
It needs moving to the model API.
For this to happen the model API needs a new method:
  
   katas_events(ids:, indexes:)   
Eg 
   katas_events(ids:['q345Ts', 'ZP9We6'], indexes:[23,6])
   
which is a BatchMethod api for

   kata_event(id:'q345Ts', index:23)
   kata_event(id:'ZP9We6', index:6)
   
This is needed for the animals_progress() functionality.
